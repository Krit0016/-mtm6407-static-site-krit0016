    <h2>Habitat Loss</h2>
    <p>Habitat loss is one of the primary drivers of species endangerment. Human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion result in the destruction and fragmentation of natural habitats, depriving species of their homes and essential resources.</p>

    <h2>Pollution</h2>
    <p>Pollution, including air pollution, water pollution, and soil contamination, poses a significant threat to wildlife. Chemical pollutants, plastic debris, and hazardous waste can adversely affect ecosystems and the health of species, leading to population declines and ecological imbalances.</p>

    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Climate change, driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, has profound impacts on biodiversity. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events disrupt ecosystems, alter habitats, and threaten the survival of species adapted to specific climatic conditions.</p>

    <h2>Overexploitation</h2>
    <p>Overexploitation occurs when species are harvested or traded at unsustainable rates. Examples include overfishing, illegal poaching for wildlife products, and the collection of rare plants for medicinal or ornamental purposes. Overexploitation can lead to population declines, genetic depletion, and ecosystem degradation.</p>

    <h2>Invasive Species</h2>
    <p>Invasive species, introduced to new environments by human activities, can outcompete native species, disrupt food webs, and alter ecosystems. Predation, competition for resources, and the spread of diseases by invasive species contribute to the decline of native wildlife populations.</p>

    <h2>Human-Wildlife Conflict</h2>
    <p>Human-wildlife conflict arises when human activities encroach upon wildlife habitats, leading to conflicts between humans and animals. Agricultural expansion, urban development, and infrastructure projects can result in habitat destruction, crop damage, and livestock predation, leading to retaliatory killings and the depletion of wildlife populations.</p>
